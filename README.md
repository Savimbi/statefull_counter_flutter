# Stateful_counter

This is a sample project to store the status of counter app using flutter

## Getting Started

There is not much to demonstrate in this project, except simple concept on how to store state of flutter app.
We focused on best practice in flutter development such as use of constant to maximize app performance.
It might be not such necessary for such small app but, it is important to optimize memory and computing power whenever develop any app.
